1_Scenario 2: A customer can be promoted to VIP status based on their balance. Question: Write a PL/SQL block that iterates through all customers and sets a flag IsVIP to TRUE for those with a balance over $10,000.

DECLARE
v_count NUMBER := 0;
BEGIN
FOR cust IN (SELECT CustomerID, Name, Balance FROM Customers)
LOOP
IF cust.Balance > 10000 THEN
UPDATE Customers
SET IsVIP = 'Y'
WHERE CustomerID = cust.CustomerID;

v_count := v_count + 1;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Customer ' || cust.Name || 
' (ID: ' || cust.CustomerID || 
') promoted to VIP status.');
END IF;
END LOOP;

IF v_count = 0 THEN
RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'No customer qualified for VIP status.');
ELSE
COMMIT;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('VIP promotion process completed. Total promoted: ' || v_count);
END IF;
