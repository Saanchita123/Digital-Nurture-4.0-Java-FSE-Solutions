1_Scenario 1: The bank wants to apply a discount to loan interest rates for customers above 60 years old.
Question: Write a PL/SQL block that loops through all customers, checks their age, and if they are above 60, apply a 1%  discount to their current loan interest rates.

DECLARE

CURSOR cust_cursor IS
SELECT CustomerID, DOB FROM Customers;
v_age NUMBER;
v_count NUMBER :=0;

BEGIN

FOR cust IN cust_cursor LOOP
v_age:= FLOOR (MONTHS_BETWEEN ( SYSDATE,  cust.DOB )/12);
IF v_age > 60 THEN
UPDATE Loans
SET InterestRate = InterestRate-1
WHERE CustomerID = cust.CustomerID;
v_count := v_count+1;
END IF;
END LOOP;

IF v_count=0 THEN
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('No customers found above age 60');
ELSE
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_count||'customer(s) updated with discounted interest rate');
END IF;
COMMIT;
END;
